# Alpha Research and Factor Modelling

In this project, I built a statistical risk model using PCA. I used this model to build a portfolio along with 5 alpha factors. I created these factors, then evaluate them using factor-weighted returns, quantile analysis, sharpe ratio, and turnover analysis. At the end of the project, I also optimized the portfolio using the risk model and factors using multiple optimization formulations. For the dataset, I used the end of day from Quotemedia.

This project was the fourth project (out of Eight Projects) in **AI for trading NanoDegree Program**, offered by Udacity. The rest of projects could be found in my GitHub Page as well.
